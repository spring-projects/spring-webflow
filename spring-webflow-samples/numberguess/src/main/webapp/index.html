  		This Spring Web Flow (SWF) sample application illustrates:
  		<ul>
	  		<li>
				Use of stateful middle-tier components to carry out the execution of game business logic.  It shows how to use SWF to
				develop such components without coupling your application code to SWF APIs.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use of custom state exception handlers to handle exceptions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use of the evaluate-action to evaluate expressions against the flow request context;
				in this example to call the "makeGuess" method on a flow-scoped "game" bean.
			</li>
		</ul>
