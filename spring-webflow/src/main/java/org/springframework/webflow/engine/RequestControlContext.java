/**
 * Mutable control interface used to manipulate an ongoing flow execution in the context of one client request.
 * Primarily used internally by the various flow artifacts when they are invoked.
 * <p>
 * This interface acts as a facade for core definition constructs such as the central <code>Flow</code> and
 * <code>State</code> classes, abstracting away details about the runtime execution machine.
 * <p>
 * Note this type is not the same as the {@link FlowExecutionContext}. Objects of this type are <i>request specific</i>:
 * they provide a control interface for manipulating exactly one flow execution locally from exactly one request. A
 * <code>FlowExecutionContext</code> provides information about a single flow execution (conversation), and it's scope
 * is not local to a specific request (or thread).
