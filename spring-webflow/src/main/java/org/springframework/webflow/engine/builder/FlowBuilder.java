/**
 * Builder interface used to build a flow definition. The process of building a flow consists of the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Initialize this builder, creating the initial flow definition, by calling {@link #init(FlowBuilderContext)}.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildVariables()} to create any variables of the flow and add them to the flow definition.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildInputMapper()} to create and set the input mapper for the flow.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildStartActions()} to create and add any start actions to the flow.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildStates()} to create the states of the flow and add them to the flow definition.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildGlobalTransitions()} to create any transitions shared by all states of the flow and add them to
 * the flow definition.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildEndActions()} to create and add any end actions to the flow.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildOutputMapper()} to create and set the output mapper for the flow.
 * <li>Call {@link #buildExceptionHandlers()} to create the exception handlers of the flow and add them to the flow
 * definition.
 * <li>Call {@link #getFlow()} to return the fully-built {@link Flow} definition.
 * <li>Dispose this builder, releasing any resources allocated during the building process by calling {@link #dispose()}.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should encapsulate flow construction logic, either for a specific kind of flow, for example, an
 * <code>OrderFlowBuilder</code> built in Java code, or a generic flow builder strategy, like the
 * <code>XmlFlowBuilder</code>, for building flows from an XML-definition.
 * <p>
 * Flow builders are used by the {@link FlowAssembler}, which acts as an assembler (director). Flow Builders may be
 * reused, however, exercise caution when doing this as these objects are not thread safe. Also, for each use be sure to
 * call init, followed by the build* methods, getFlow, and dispose completely in that order.
 * <p>
 * This is a good example of the classic GoF builder pattern.
