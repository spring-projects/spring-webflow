/**
 * Builder interface used to build a flow model. The process of building a flow model consists of the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Initialize this builder by calling {@link #init()}.
 * <li>Call {@link #build()} to create the flow model.
 * <li>Call {@link #getFlowModel()} to return the fully-built {@link FlowModel} model.
 * <li>Dispose this builder, releasing any resources allocated during the building process by calling {@link #dispose()}.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should encapsulate flow construction logic, either for a specific kind of flow, for example, an
 * <code>XmlFlowModelBuilder</code>, for building flows from an XML-definition.
 * <p>
 * This is a good example of the classic GoF builder pattern.
