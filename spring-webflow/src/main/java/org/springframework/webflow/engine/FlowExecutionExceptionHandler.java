/**
 * A strategy for handling an exception that occurs at runtime during an active flow execution.
 * 
 * Note: special care should be taken when implementing custom flow execution exception handlers. Exception handlers are
 * like Transitions in that they direct flow control when exceptions occur. They are more complex than Actions, which
 * can only execute behaviors and return results that drive flow control. For this reason, if implemented incorrectly, a
 * FlowExecutionHandler can leave a flow execution in an invalid state, which can render the flow execution unusable or
 * its future use undefined. For example, if an exception thrown at flow session startup gets routed to an exception
 * handler, the handler must take responsibility for ensuring the flow execution returns control to the caller in a
 * consistent state. Concretely, this means the exception handler must transition the flow to its start state. The
 * handler should not simply return leaving the flow with no current state set.
 * 
 * Note: Because flow execution handlers are more difficult to implement correctly, consider catching exceptions in your
 * web flow action code and returning result events that drive standard transitions. Alternatively, consider use of the
 * existing {@code TransitionExecutingFlowExecutionExceptionHandler} which illustrates the proper way to implement an
 * exception handler.
