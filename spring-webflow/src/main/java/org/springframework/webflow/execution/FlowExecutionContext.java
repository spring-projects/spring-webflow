/**
 * Provides contextual information about a flow execution. A flow execution is an runnable instance of a

 * This immutable interface provides access to runtime information about the conversation, such as it's
 * {@link #isActive() status} and {@link #getActiveSession() current state}.
 * <p>
 * An object implementing this interface is also traversable from a execution request context (see
 * {@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.RequestContext#getFlowExecutionContext()}).
 * <p>
 * This interface provides information that may span more than one request in a thread safe manner. The
 * {@link RequestContext} interface defines a <i>request specific</i> control interface for manipulating exactly one
 * flow execution locally from exactly one request.
