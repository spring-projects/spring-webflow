/**
 * Signals the occurrence of something an active flow execution should respond to. Each event has a string id that
 * provides a key for identifying what happened: e.g "coinInserted", or "pinDropped". Events may have attributes that
 * provide arbitrary payload data, e.g. "coin.amount=25", or "pinDropSpeed=25ms".
 * <p>
 * As an example, a "submit" event might signal that a Submit button was pressed in a web browser. A "success" event
 * might signal an action executed successfully. A "finish" event might signal a subflow ended normally.
 * <p>
 * Why is this not an interface? A specific design choice. An event is not a strategy that defines a generic type or
 * role--it is essentially an immutable value object. It is expected that specializations of this base class be "Events"
 * and not part of some other inheritance hierarchy.
