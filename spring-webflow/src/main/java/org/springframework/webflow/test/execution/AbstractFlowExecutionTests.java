/**
 * Base class for tests that verify a flow executes as expected. Flow execution tests authored by subclasses should test
 * that a flow responds to all supported transition criteria correctly, transitioning to the correct states and
 * producing the expected results on the occurrence of external events.
 * <p>
 * A typical flow execution test case will test:
 * <ul>
 * <li>That the flow execution starts as expected (see {@link #startFlow(MutableAttributeMap, ExternalContext)}).
 * <li>That a state executes the appropriate transition when an event is signaled. A test case should be authored for
 * each logical event that can occur, where an event triggers a transition representing a path through the flow. The
 * goal should be to exercise all state transitions (see the {@link #resumeFlow(ExternalContext)} variants and the
 * {@link #setCurrentState(String)} for more information).
 * <li>That given a transition that leads to an interactive state type (such as a view state or an end state), the view
 * selected matches what was expected and the current state of the flow matches what is expected.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A flow execution test can effectively automate and validate the orchestration required to drive an end-to-end
 * business task that spans several steps involving the user to complete. Such tests are a good way to test your system
 * top-down starting at the web-tier and pushing through all the way to the DB without having to deploy to a servlet
 * container. In addition, they can be used to effectively test a flow's execution (the web layer) standalone,
 * typically with a mock service layer.
