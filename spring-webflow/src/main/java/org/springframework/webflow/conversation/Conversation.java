/**
 * A service interface for working with state associated with a single logical user interaction called a "conversation"
 * in the scope of a single request. Conversation objects are not thread safe and should not be shared among multiple
 * threads.
 * <p>
 * A conversation provides a "task" context that is begun and eventually ends. Between the beginning and the end
 * attributes can be placed in and read from a conversation's context.
 * <p>
 * A conversation needs to be {@link #lock() locked} to obtain exclusive access to it before it can be manipulated. Once
 * manipulation is finished, you need to {@link #unlock() unlock} the conversation. So code interacting with a
 * conversation always looks like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Conversation conv = ...;
 * conv.lock();
 * try {
 *    // work with the Conversation object, calling methods like
 *    // getAttribute(), putAttribute() and end()
 * }
 * finally {
 *    conv.unlock();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the attributes associated with a conversation are not "conversation scope" as defined for a flow execution.
 * They can be any attributes, possibly technical in nature, associated with the conversation.
